# Purple Martin Tracker app

Purple Martins are the largest member of the swallow family. They winter in South America, and summer in North America, where they live and breed almost exclusively in human-maintained nest colonies. Purple Martin "landlords" do routine *nest checks*, in which they clean the houses and take inventory. The current standard of collecting and storing this data is pen and paper, and this project aims to modernize the process.
